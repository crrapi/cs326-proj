# Stock Portfolio Visualizer

## Team 9

## Project Description

### Problem

Most stock visualization tools lack intuitive representations of portfolio performance. Traditional stock charts can be difficult to interpret at a glance, especially when trying to understand how multiple stocks contribute to overall portfolio performance. Investors often struggle to quickly assess their portfolio's composition and performance without diving into complex charts and data tables.

### Solution

Our Stock Portfolio Visualizer creates a more intuitive way to visualize stock portfolios using p5.js and/or HTML canvas. By assigning different colors to each stock and layering them in a unified view, investors can instantly understand their portfolio composition and performance trends. This approach transforms complex financial data into an easy-to-interpret visual representation.

### Key Features

- Portfolio Input: Users can input their stock purchases (ticker symbol, quantity, purchase date, and price)
- Data Integration: Connects to stock APIs to fetch current and historical price data
- Persistent Storage: Saves portfolio information in a database for easy access
- Intuitive Visualization: Uses p5.js to create color-coded, layered visualizations that show how each stock contributes to overall portfolio performance
- Performance Metrics: Displays key portfolio statistics and metrics to complement the visual representation

### Why This Project?

As investors ourselves, we understand the challenge of quickly assessing portfolio performance without getting lost in numbers and traditional charts. Our visualization approach provides a "quick glance" solution that gives investors immediate insight into their portfolio's composition and performance. This tool bridges the gap between complex financial data and intuitive visual understanding, helping investors make more informed decisions with less effort.
